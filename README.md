# Handwritten digits recognition
This repository contains my exercises and experiments from Chapter 4 of the FastAI: Deep Learning for Coders book by Jeremy Howard.
The goal of these notebooks is to understand the building blocks of neural networks by progressing from a simple linear model to a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The easiest ways to run the notebook is to open Google Colab and refer to this repository.
