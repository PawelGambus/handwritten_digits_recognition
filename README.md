# Handwritten digits recognition
This repository contains three notebooks that implement an algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST datasate. 

The notebooks show three approaches to tackle the problem:
1. Develop a **manual algorithm** to train a linear model  to racognize the digits.
2. Develop a simple **neural network** (NN).
3. Develop a **convolutional neural network** (CNN).

The easiest ways to run the notebook is to open Google Colab and refer to this repository.
